## Guide to changing emulator's `hosts` file

This is the most important thing to do, since the original servers just give a 404 response to the client.

**Please don't change your hosts file on an actual, physical device since I honestly don't know when this project will be stable.**

This guide may not work for all emulators, but I'm using the one I'd reccomend, **Bluestacks**.
You obviously need a PC for this.

Download these things:

- [Bluestacks](https://bluestacks.com/download) (obviously)
- [Android SDK Platform Tools](https://developer.android.com/studio) (used for communicating with your device) (you can also download it from Android Studio);
- [Monster Hunter Explore](https://archive.org/details/monster-hunter-explore-data) (you can directly import the APK onto bluestacks)
